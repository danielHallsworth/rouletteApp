This app was developed to practice DOM manipulation:
- Creating, Appending, Removing elements
- Adding event listeners

Problems developing the app:
- Building upon pre-existing code: https://codepen.io/barney-parker/pen/OPyYqy/?editors=0010
  souloution to this was break down existing code, comment its purpose and split it up into seperate smaller functions
- Not using jQuery and sticking to vanilla JavaScript. the souloution was to learn and read more about DOM manipulation in JavaScript
